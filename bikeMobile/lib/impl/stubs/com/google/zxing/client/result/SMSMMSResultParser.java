/**
 *  <p>Parses an "sms:" URI result, which specifies a number to SMS.
 *  See <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5724"> RFC 5724</a> on this.</p>
 * 
 *  <p>This class supports "via" syntax for numbers, which is not part of the spec.
 *  For example "+12125551212;via=+12124440101" may appear as a number.
 *  It also supports a "subject" query parameter, which is not mentioned in the spec.
 *  These are included since they were mentioned in earlier IETF drafts and might be
 *  used.</p>
 * 
 *  <p>This actually also parses URIs starting with "mms:" and treats them all the same way,
 *  and effectively converts them to an "sms:" URI for purposes of forwarding to the platform.</p>
