/**
 *  A list view that can show a list of profiles.  
 *  
 *  .A ProfileListView rendering an EntityList with 2 entities, and 2 actions.
 *  image::https://shannah.github.io/RADChatRoom/images/Image-220220-084136.625.png[]
 *  
 *  Each row shows the profile avatar/icon,
 *  name, and optionally a set of actions that will be rendered as buttons for the user to perform.  Row click 
 *  events can be handled by registering an action in the {@link #ACCOUNT_LIST_ROW_SELECTED} category.  Row actions
 *  can be assigned to the {@link #ACCOUNT_LIST_ROW_ACTIONS} category.
 *  
 *  === View Model Requirements
 *  
 *  This view will accept any {@link EntityList} where the row items are "profiles". For best results, each profile
 *  should contain a name and icon, although it will fall back to suitable output if one or both of those fields are missing.
 *  
 *  The icon is rendered using the {@link ProfileAvatarView} view, so see its docs for details on what information it needs.  A simple
 *  solution, that will always work, is to make sure that the profile entities contain properties tagged with {@link Thing#name} and {@link Thing#thumbnailUrl}.
 *  
 *  Since rows are rendered using {@link ProfileListRowView}, you can also see its docs for information about row view model requirements.
 *  
 *  === Supported Actions
 *  
 *  The following actions are supported by this view:
 *  
 *   . {@link #ACCOUNT_LIST_ROW_ACTIONS}
 *   . {@link #ACCOUNT_LIST_ROW_SELECTED}
 *
