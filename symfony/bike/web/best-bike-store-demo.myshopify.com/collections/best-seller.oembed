Well, where’s the adventure in that? Diamondback went a different route entirely. By adding 2.8” wide, plus-size tires to their Level Link suspension, they’ve created a bike that absolutely rips on tight trails, but does so with the extra grip and control of a plus-size bike. Voila — adventure made awesome. Diamondback gave the Catch a slack-but-not-too-slack front end. They wanted control on fast descents but weren’t willing to give up maneuverability on tight trails. A Shimano Deore 1x10-speed drivetrain gives you the gearing to tackle any terrain and TRP Slate X2 hydraulic disc brakes bring this machine to a tidy stop. If you’re looking to tackle rough terrain and want the ultimate in control, without sacrificing the thrill of riding, the Catch is your bike.\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"BestBike - Bike Store Business Shopify Theme","offers":[{"title":"S \/ White","offer_id":31949463224460,"sku":"","price":850.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"S \/ SteelBlue","offer_id":31949463257228,"sku":"","price":850.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"S \/ Red","offer_id":31949463289996,"sku":"","price":850.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"S \/ YellowGreen","offer_id":31949463322764,"sku":"","price":850.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"M \/ White","offer_id":31949463355532,"sku":"","price":850.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"M \/ SteelBlue","offer_id":31949463388300,"sku":"","price":850.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"M \/ Red","offer_id":31949463421068,"sku":"","price":850.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"M \/ YellowGreen","offer_id":31949463453836,"sku":"","price":850.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"L \/ White","offer_id":31949463486604,"sku":"","price":850.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"L \/ SteelBlue","offer_id":31949463519372,"sku":"","price":850.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"L \/ Red","offer_id":31949463552140,"sku":"","price":850.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"L \/ YellowGreen","offer_id":31949463584908,"sku":"","price":850.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"XL \/ White","offer_id":31949463617676,"sku":"","price":850.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"XL \/ SteelBlue","offer_id":31949463650444,"sku":"","price":850.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"XL \/ Red","offer_id":31949463683212,"sku":"","price":850.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"XL \/ YellowGreen","offer_id":31949463715980,"sku":"","price":850.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0321\/8109\/2492\/products\/4.1_47c86090-a5dc-4706-a4a2-9046d1755b30.jpg?v=1580464241"},{"product_id":"diamondback-atroz","title":"Diamondback Atroz","description":"\n\u003cdiv class=\"container container-v2 py-4\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"row\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"col-md-6\"\u003e\u003ca\u003e \u003cimg src=\"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0321\/8109\/2492\/files\/product1.jpg?v=1581019127\" alt=\"\"\u003e \u003c\/a\u003e\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"col-md-6 info1\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eHigh-quality  \u003cbr\u003e Aluminum frame\u003c\/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe love hardtails, but there’s no denying the benefits of full-suspension mountain bikes - the added comfort and control.
