{"product_id":"diamondback-overdrive-1","title":"Diamondback Overdrive 2","description":"\u003cp class=\"ml-3 mr-3\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\u003eThe classic 29er hardtail — that’s the best way to describe Diamondback's premier aluminum model. They’ve taken their strong and light aluminum 29er frame and increased the stiffness and handling precision by adding Boost 148 rear spacing and thru-axles front and rear. They’ve also dressed the bike in an envy-provoking parts package that includes a plush and confidence-inspiring RockShox Reba RL fork, strong Shimano hydraulic disc brakes, and a SRAM GX\/NX 1x drivetrain that provides you plenty of granny gear for the ugliest of climbs, without the complexity of a traditional front derailleur system. Thanks to its 29er wheels, cleaning tricky rock sections and log-overs is a whole lot less tricky on this big wheeler, and since you can never have enough traction — particularly on a hardtail — we went the extra step and equipped this Overdrive with our own Blanchard 25 tubeless ready wheelset. Ready Ride bikes are shipped 95 percent assembled. Typical bike assembly is time-consuming and requires technical know-how. Ready Ride reduces the time and skills needed for the final, four-step assembly.\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"BestBike - Bike Store Business Shopify Theme","offers":[{"title":"S \/ Orange","offer_id":31972352524428,"sku":"","price":788.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"S \/ YellowGreen","offer_id":31972352557196,"sku":"","price":788.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"S \/ Black","offer_id":31972352589964,"sku":"","price":788.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"M \/ Orange","offer_id":31972352622732,"sku":"","price":788.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"M \/ YellowGreen","offer_id":31972352655500,"sku":"","price":788.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"M \/ Black","offer_id":31972352688268,"sku":"","price":788.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"L \/ Orange","offer_id":31972352721036,"sku":"","price":788.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"L \/ YellowGreen","offer_id":31972352753804,"sku":"","price":788.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"L \/ Black","offer_id":31972352786572,"sku":"","price":788.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"XL \/ Orange","offer_id":31972352819340,"sku":"","price":788.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"XL \/ YellowGreen","offer_id":31972352852108,"sku":"","price":788.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"XL \/ Black","offer_id":31972352884876,"sku":"","price":788.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0321\/8109\/2492\/products\/12.1_fc2b0a14-92d0-4711-bde5-a68c5fdcb479.jpg?v=1580655059","url":"https:\/\/best-bike-store-demo.myshopify.com\/products\/diamondback-overdrive-1","provider":"Bestbike - Bike Store Business Shopify Theme","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
